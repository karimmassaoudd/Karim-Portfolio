                    <h2>GOAL:</h2>
                    <p>The goal for this project was to follow a professional design process while working as part of a team. We focused on creating a full, 
                        high-quality brand concept for the fictional client Owen Bryce. My personal aim was to contribute at a professional level 
                        by doing detailed user research, creating strong UX and UI designs, and helping my team stay organized with clear roles, planning, 
                        and structure. I wanted to experience what it feels like to work in a real-world design environment and take my responsibilities seriously 
                        from start to finish.

                    <h2>ACTION:</h2>
                    <p>At the beginning of the project, we created a team chart to assign clear roles and responsibilities so everyone knew what they were in charge 
                        of. I took part in writing the project plan, which helped us stay on schedule and made sure communication stayed clear between team members.
                        As part of the professional workflow, I also conducted an interview to collect insights from someone outside the team. I asked thoughtful, 
                        open-ended questions about their opinions on the Owen Bryce brand idea what they liked, what they would expect, and how it could be improved. 
                        Their answers helped us understand what users might actually need and want from the brand.
                        Using that feedback, I created a detailed persona that represented our target user. This helped guide both the UX and UI design decisions I 
                        worked on for the project. I made sure that my designs were user-centered and matched the expectations we gathered during our research. 
                        Throughout the process, I supported my team by communicating regularly and sharing my progress, ideas, and improvements.

                    <h2>IMPROVEMENTS:</h2>
                    <p>By taking the time to gather and apply feedback from the interview, I was able to design features that were more realistic and user-focused. 
                        I went back to revise the persona, making sure it reflected real needs and goals. I also made changes to the design layout to improve the user 
                        flow and overall clarity.
                        Working as part of a team helped me improve the way I communicate my ideas and explain my design choices. I learned how to give and receive 
                        feedback respectfully and how to blend our different skills to improve the quality of the final outcome. This collaborative environment helped 
                        all of us grow and deliver something that looked and felt professional.

                    <h2>REFLECTION:</h2>
                    <p>This project helped me realize how important it is to follow professional standards when working on a team. Things like project planning, interviews, and clear roles are not just for organization — they actually make the design process smoother and the final product better. The interview gave me a new perspective I saw how much more meaningful a design can be when it's based on real user feedback, not just personal ideas or guesses.
                        I also saw the value in teamwork how structure and planning lead to better collaboration. Everyone contributed something unique, and we stayed focused on our shared goal. That made me more confident in group settings and more aware of how to carry myself professionally.

        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED <span class="gradient">THROUGH THIS PROCESS:</span></h2>
        <p>
            WHAT I LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS
            I learned how to approach a design project in a way that reflects real industry standards. This meant starting with a solid project plan, clearly defining 
            the team’s roles, setting realistic deadlines, and making sure we stayed organized throughout the entire process. I learned how to use tools and strategies 
            that professional teams rely on like team charts, timelines, and regular check-ins to keep things moving efficiently.
            One of the most important skills I developed was learning how to conduct user interviews. I discovered how to ask the right questions to get meaningful, 
            honest feedback from real people not just surface-level answers. From these interviews, I learned how to take what I heard and turn it into something 
            useful: a detailed user persona that guided our design choices. It made our design more relevant and more aligned with what the target user actually needs.
            I also improved a lot in terms of teamwork and communication. I became better at sharing my ideas clearly, listening to feedback from others, and working 
            together to make group decisions. I learned how to combine my creativity with structure — making sure that my designs weren’t just nice to look at, but 
            also practical and based on solid research. Most importantly, I realized that great design happens when everyone contributes and when ideas are shaped by 
            both collaboration and user insight.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED why">
        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS <span class="gradient">TO ME:</span></h2>
        <p>
            This project matters to me because it gave me my first real experience of working like a professional designer not just someone creating designs on 
            their own, but someone working in a team, communicating with others, and making decisions based on actual user needs. It showed me that professional 
            design isn’t only about being creative it’s also about being organized, thoughtful, and responsible.
            It pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best way. I had to take initiative, lead certain tasks, and be accountable for my part in the project. 
            I learned how to stay focused on the user, think ahead, and bring everything together in a way that met both creative and professional goals. It also 
            taught me how much value there is in research in really understanding the “why” behind every design choice.        
            This experience gave me more than just technical skills. It gave me confidence the confidence to speak up in a team, to explain my work clearly, and 
            to take on challenges I might have avoided before. I now feel ready to step into more complex projects, work with real clients, and apply everything 
            I’ve learned in a professional setting. It helped shape the kind of designer I want to be: someone who is creative, reliable, and user-focused.
