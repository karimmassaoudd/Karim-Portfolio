                    <h2>GOAL:</h2>
                    <p>My goal was to build my own personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I wanted to create something fully functional and responsive from scratch not just design it, 
                    but also bring it to life with real code. This was a big step for me, especially because I had no experience with JavaScript before. 
                    I also wanted to get better at working like a real developer, using tools like Git and GitHub to manage my code and track changes.

                    <h2>ACTION:</h2>
                    <p>To get started with JavaScript, I watched this helpful YouTube video tutorial:
                        JavaScript For Beginners Full Course
                        It gave me a clear introduction to how JavaScript works and how it connects with HTML and CSS.  
                        After that, I practiced every day. I did bootcamp-style exercises and small challenges that helped me understand things 
                        like variables, functions, and events. I used what I learned to build features for my portfolio, like a responsive navigation bar, 
                        smooth scrolling, and transitions that made the site feel more interactive. <br> 
                        <br>  I also reached out to Maikel for help. I sent him one of my practice exercises, and he gave me detailed feedback. 
                        He showed me how to improve my code and explained easier ways to solve problems. This made a huge difference, it helped me understand JavaScript logic better and feel more confident about using it.  
                        Along the way, I used Git and GitHub to save my work and track my progress. 
                        This helped me stay organized and made it easier to go back if I needed to fix something. It also made me feel more like a real developer, 
                        using the same tools professionals use.

                    <p>As I kept working, my code started to look much cleaner and more organized. 
                        I learned how to structure it properly, add comments, and split it into smaller parts so I could manage it more easily. 
                        I also improved how I set up my project folders and kept everything neat and easy to understand.
                        My site became more responsive, it worked well on phones, tablets, and laptops. 
                        The JavaScript features like the menu and animations became smoother, and I fixed a lot of small issues thanks to the feedback I got. 
                        Maikel’s tips helped me write simpler code that still worked just as well, and I realized I could reuse the same ideas in other projects too.

                    <p>At first, JavaScript felt confusing and overwhelming. I didn’t know where to begin, and the code didn’t make much sense. 
                        But by watching tutorials, practicing every day, and asking for help, I started to understand it. 
                        I realized that learning to code takes time, and it's okay to make mistakes along the way.
                        Talking to Maikel and getting his feedback showed me how helpful it is to learn from others. 
                        He explained things in a way that made sense and gave me more confidence. I also began thinking more like a developer, 
                        instead of giving up when something didn’t work, I took a step-by-step approach to solve problems and improve my work.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED">
        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED <span class="gradient">THROUGH THIS PROCESS:</span></h2>
        <p>
            I learned how to build a complete, real-world website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptstarting from a blank page and turning it into a working portfolio.
            I now know how to structure my code properly, use semantic HTML for better accessibility, apply CSS for styling and layout, and add interactivity 
            with JavaScript. These skills helped me bring my design ideas to life and create a website that is not only visually appealing but also responsive and functional across different devices.
            I also learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my code. Using version control helped me stay organized, 
            track my progress, and feel more in control of the development process just like real developers do. 
            On top of that, I completed several bootcamp assignments that challenged me to apply what I was learning in small, focused exercises. 
            These tasks helped me understand the basics of JavaScript, such as variables, functions, conditionals, and event listeners. 
            Each assignment gave me more confidence and made it easier to apply those same concepts to my own project.
            But the most important thing I learned was how to learn. Even when things felt difficult especially with JavaScript 
            I kept going by watching tutorials, practicing daily, doing exercises, and asking for help. 
            I realized how important it is to break problems into small steps, take feedback seriously, and keep improving over time. This process taught me technical skills, but also made me a more patient and confident problem solver.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED why">
        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS <span class="gradient">TO ME:</span></h2>
        <p>
            This project matters to me because it shows how far I’ve come. When I started, I had almost no experience with JavaScript and wasn’t sure if 
            I could build a working site on my own. But through practice, completing bootcamp assignments, and applying feedback, I created something real, 
            a portfolio website that I fully designed and developed myself.
            It also showed me that I can learn new things, even when they seem hard at first. By stepping out of my comfort zone, I discovered that I enjoy both 
            design and development. I’m not just someone who can create nice visuals — I can also bring those designs to life with real code.
            This project gave me a strong foundation for the future. I now have real skills I can use in other projects, freelance work, or job opportunities. 
            I’m proud of what I made, and even more proud of how much I’ve grown. It motivates me to keep going, keep learning, and keep building.
