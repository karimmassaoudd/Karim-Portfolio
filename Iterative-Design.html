                    <h2>GOAL:</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal for this project was to apply iterative design principles to develop a complete and consistent brand identity  
                        both for myself and for a fictional client named Owen Bryce. I wanted to follow the full process a designer goes through in 
                        real-world projects: from research and planning to creating polished final assets. This included working on my personal portfolio, 
                        developing user experience (UX) designs, crafting a detailed brand guide, and building a strong visual identity for the client. 
                        I aimed to strengthen my ability to not only create visually appealing work but also to stay consistent with branding and user needs 
                        across different platforms and design elements.

                <div class="grid-text">
                    <h2>ACTION:</h2>
                    <p>I started the project by researching design inspiration and planning the visual direction for both my personal brand and Owen Bryce’s identity. 
                        I created mood boards that helped me define the overall tone, colors, and style of the designs. These mood boards acted as visual guides that I could keep 
                        referring to throughout the project.
                        For the fictional client, Owen Bryce, I developed a complete brand identity from scratch. I began by sketching logo ideas and exploring different 
                        concepts that would reflect the brand’s personality and values. After refining the designs, I finalized a logo that felt professional, versatile, 
                        and aligned with the client’s goals.             
                        Next, I created a style scape — a visual layout that includes brand colours, typography, textures, and design references. This helped me keep all visual decisions consistent and guided the look and feel of every part of the brand.        
                        To help me stay user-focused, I also developed user personas, which helped me think more deeply about how users would interact with my designs 
                        especially my portfolio. These personas included fictional users with different goals, which helped shape the layout, content, and navigation decisions 
                        in my UX design.             
                        Throughout the project, I applied everything I was learning to my portfolio, making sure it reflected my personal design style while staying consistent with 
                        UX best practices. I also created a full brand guide for Owen Bryce, which included rules for logo usage, colour codes, font choices, tone of voice, and overall 
                        visual language. This brand guide made sure the identity could stay consistent in the future, across different media and platforms.

                    <h2>IMPROVEMENTS:</h2>
                    <p>
                        During this project, I made many improvements by going through multiple design drafts and using feedback from others. 
                        I revised the logo several times to make sure it worked well in different sizes and contexts. I adjusted my colour palette for better contrast and accessibility, 
                        ensuring the brand could be used effectively across all screen types and print materials.
                        I improved my typography by creating a clearer visual hierarchy making it easier to scan and read content. 
                        My mood boards and user personas also became more refined with each revision, as I gathered new ideas and insights.
                        Another big improvement was the overall consistency across my designs. I followed the visual rules I created in the style scape and 
                        brand guide closely, which helped all my work feel like it belonged to the same system from the portfolio to the client project.

                    <h2>REFLECTION:</h2>
                    <p>This project taught me that design is never finished in one try. Almost every part from logo sketches to the final layout needed 
                        changes and multiple versions before I got to something that worked. Iteration helped me not only make the visuals better, 
                        but also improve the ideas behind them. I saw how important it is to get feedback, take breaks to review my work, and stay open to making changes.
                        Instead of seeing revisions as a problem, I started to see them as a normal and essential part of the design process. 
                        This mindset helped me improve faster and feel more confident in my decisions. The more I revised, the better the outcome became 
                        and that made me proud of the final results.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED">
        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED <span class="gradient">THROUGH THIS PROCESS:</span></h2>
        <p>
            I learned how to go through a complete iterative design process, just like professional designers do. I started with research and inspiration, then moved into brainstorming, sketching, creating design assets, and constantly refining my work based on testing and feedback. This helped me understand that design isn’t a one-step job it’s about experimenting, 
            learning from each version, and improving over time.
            I got better at using tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator, especially for building brand identities, creating layout structures, designing logos, and 
            developing style scapes that communicate a clear and consistent visual direction. I also learned how to create design systems that bring together colours, 
            typography, textures, and layout rules into one unified look.
            Another major thing I learned was how to think like a UX designer. Creating personas helped me stay focused on user needs, and mood boards helped guide the 
            overall feeling and direction of my designs. I now know how to think critically, not just about how something looks but about how it works and how people will 
            interact with it. 
            Just as importantly, I learned the value of reviewing my own work. I practiced stepping back, finding what could be improved, and then making those changes. 
            Feedback from teachers and classmates showed me areas I missed and helped me take my ideas to the next level. I’ve learned to see feedback not as criticism, but
            as a powerful tool to grow as a designer.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED why">
        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS <span class="gradient">TO ME:</span></h2>
        <p>
            This project means a lot to me because it combined everything I love about design creativity, structure, problem-solving, and visual storytelling. 
            I had the chance to build something meaningful for myself while also designing a full brand identity for a fictional client, which made the project feel 
            like real client work. That mix of personal and professional challenges helped me grow in every way.
            It was also the first time I worked through the entire design process from start to finish including the difficult parts, like multiple revisions and 
            fixing design flaws I didn’t notice at first. I used to think design was mostly about creativity, but this project taught me that it’s also about being 
            patient, thoughtful, and open to change.
            Finishing this project gave me confidence. It showed me that I’m not just someone learning design I’m someone who can create professional work, present 
            it clearly, and explain the thinking behind it. Now, I feel more prepared to work on real projects, collaborate with clients, and keep growing in this 
            field. This project has become one of the strongest pieces in my portfolio, and I’m proud of everything it represents.
