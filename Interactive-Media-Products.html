                    <h2>GOAL:</h2>
                    <p>My main goal was to design my personal portfolio in Figma in a way that reflects who I am as a designer.
                    I aimed for a layout that is clean, professional, and easy to navigate, with a strong focus on visual hierarchy and user-friendly interaction. 
                    I wanted each section to clearly represent my personality, creativity, and the skills I’ve developed throughout my journey. 
                    In addition to the portfolio itself, I also worked on developing a visual brand for the site, including 
                    a consistent color scheme, logo, and typography that aligns with my design identity. 
                    I also began designing a mobile app as part of the project to explore more interactive design skills and to ensure
                    my designs adapt across different platforms.

                <div class="grid-text">
                    <h2>ACTION:</h2>
                    <p>I began by researching different portfolio and branding examples to understand what makes a strong and appealing design.
                        This included studying how others presented their work, structured their pages, and used visual elements to tell their story. 
                        From there, I created wireframes to plan out the basic structure of my portfolio, focusing on clarity and flow. 
                        I structured the layout in Figma using grids and alignment tools to maintain a professional and balanced appearance. <br>
                        I included key sections such as About Me, Projects, and Contact, making sure each section had its own visual importance 
                        but still felt part of a unified whole. I paid attention to using consistent colours, fonts,
                        and spacing that match my personal branding and create a smooth user experience. I also started working on a mobile app concept,
                        designing the interface for smaller screens while applying the same branding rules. <br> After completing the first version, I asked for
                        feedback from my teacher and classmates, who pointed out areas of improvement that I might have missed on my own.
                        I took notes from the feedback and used it to guide my next steps.

                <div class="grid-text">
                    <h2>IMPROVEMENTS:</h2>
                    <p>Based on feedback, I made several improvements to both the desktop and mobile versions of my designs.
                    I adjusted alignment and spacing to ensure better balance and visual harmony between elements. 
                    I increased the contrast between text and background colours to improve readability, especially 
                    on smaller screens or under different lighting conditions. I also made sure the typography was legible and clear,
                    choosing fonts that work well for both headings and body text. I redesigned some of the icons and buttons to make
                    them more intuitive and interactive. One major improvement was making the navigation bar fixed at the top, which
                    allowed users to access different sections of the site more easily without needing to scroll back up.
                    I tested the responsiveness by previewing the design across different screen sizes in Figma, making small changes
                    to padding and layout to ensure everything scaled properly.

                    <h2>REFLECTION:</h2>
                    <p>This project really helped me grow as a designer. I started with the goal of making a personal portfolio that looks professional and
                        reflects who I am, and I ended up creating something I’m truly proud of. I designed both desktop and mobile versions using Figma, made everything easy to use, and kept the style clean and consistent with my personal brand.
                        Along the way, I learned how to plan layouts better, improve user experience, and use feedback to make my work stronger.
                        I even started designing a mobile app, which helped me explore more creative and interactive ideas.
                        In the end, I now have a complete portfolio design that shows my skills, my style, and the progress I’ve made.
                        The next step is to build the website and bring it to life online.

        <h2>WHAT I LEARNED <span class="gradient">THROUGH THIS PROCESS:</span></h2>
        <p>
            I learned how to take an idea and turn it into a full digital design, step by step. 
            I got much better at using Figma especially when it comes to planning layouts, keeping my design consistent, 
            and creating versions for both desktop and mobile. I also learned how to think like a user by asking myself: 
            “What would someone want to see first?” or “Is this easy to use?”
            I improved in using important design skills like contrast, spacing, and alignment to make everything look clear and balanced. 
            I also learned how helpful feedback is. It showed me things I missed and helped me fix small details to make my design even better. 
            Overall, this project helped me understand what it really means to design something with both style and function.

    <section class="WHAT-I-LEARNED why">
        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS <span class="gradient">TO ME:</span></h2>
        <p>
            This project matters to me because it’s something real that I can actually use to show who I am as a designer.
            It’s the first time I’ve put together everything I’ve learned designing a portfolio, building a brand, and making something that works on both computer and phone screens.
            It shows how much I’ve improved, and it’s something I’m proud of. 
            I now have a design that represents me and my skills, and I can keep building on it in the future.
            It also motivates me to keep learning and growing. This project is a big step forward for me, and it shows I’m ready for more real design work ahead.
